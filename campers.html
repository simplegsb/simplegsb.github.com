		<h2>Lucille</h2>

		<p>Lucille was a 16 seater mini-bus. I whipped out all of her seats and fitted her as a luxury moving home. Some lucky guy picker her up for cheap since I was leaving europe and needed a quick sale during winter...</p>

		<h2>Gertrude</h2>

		<p>Gertrude was my first camper van. She was given an ugly name to match her... well... ugliness. When I bought her she was already fitted out but I decided it was shit, pulled everything out and started from scratch. Lots of fun! Sadly Gertrude died and was unable to complete her last mission to Edinburgh. May she rest in peace... as a cube... because I had her crushed into a cube.</p>

		<h2>Timmy</h2>

		<p>Timmy gets a special mention. He was not a full-fledged camper, just a station wagon I threw a matress into the back of. He was my home for a few months though so he deserves to be here :)</p>

		<h2>Big Deal</h2>

		<p>Now, after numerous extensions to the release date and exceeding the budget 10 fold, the most anticipated film of Summer 07-08 is here! What's more, all the critics are hailing it as 'worth the wait' and 'revolutionary'. P.S. Why is it that every second film you see an add for is 'revolutionary'? That's bullshit.</p>

		<h2>Destructive Love</h2>

		<p>A three part mocumentary series about the making of a show called "Enduring Love". I made it with a few friends from the Screen and Media classes at Uni and some acting students we got to act with us. Originally we intended to screen this on Big TV (the Uni's TV station) but it went under before we got the chance!</p>

		<h2>Film</h2>

		<p>
			At University I took a couple of Screen and Media papers as my electorates. Most of what I've made has no seriousness at all and I like that.

		<h3>Personal Projects</h3>

		<h4>Str8 Gangsta</h4>

		<p>
			An instant cult classic. The first film officially made by simple entertainment (me). This film may or may not depict graphic violence and strong course language.

		<h4>Big Deal</h4>

		<p>
			Now, after numerous extensions to the release date and exceeding the budget 10 fold, the most anticipated film of Summer 07-08 is here! What's more, all the critics are hailing it as 'worth the wait' and 'revolutionary'. P.S. Why is it that every second film you see an add for is 'revolutionary'? That's bullshit.

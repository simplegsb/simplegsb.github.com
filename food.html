		<h2>Food</h2>

		<q>Let food be thy medicine and medicine be thy food</q> ~ Hippocrates, the father of modern medicine

		<q>Ninety per cent of the diseases known to man are caused by cheap foodstuffs. You are what you eat.</q> ~ Victor Lindlahr

		<h3>An Apple A Day Keeps The Doctor Away</h3>

		<p>
			Do you eat an apple a day? If you give your body the opportunity it will amaze you with what it can do. We have been conditioned to reach for the medicine cabinet whenever we feel pain, fatigue or illness. Don't get me wrong, there are some good tools in there when it comes to accute illness but when it comes to long term conditions they merely attack the symptoms. What is the cause though? You haven't eaten your apple and the doctor has come knocking on your door. He's offering salvation if you hand over your wallet. The answer is not as simple as eating an apple though, you also need to stop eating the ice cream. That's where we seem to have come unstuck.

		<h3>But I'm Not That Unhealthy...</h3>

		<p>
			A lot of us don't pay too much attention to what we eat. We eat what tastes good. We might eat some healthy food with the misconception that it will make up for the unhealthy food. We might think we're healthy when we compare ourselves with others around us. Unfortunately the average person is not the best benchmark to compare yourself against. The New Zealand Ministry of Health conducted a survey in 2008/09 that found "one in three adults were overweight (37.0%) and one in four were obese (27.8%)". That's a combined 64.8% of people in NZ that were overweight in 2008/09 and the wolrdwide trends suggest it is worsening.
		</p>

		<p>
			When I saw the doctor a while ago (before I went Vegan) he weighed me in at about 97kg I think (I'm about 6'1") and he suggested that I lose weight. I checked my stats against the BMI when I got home and was surprised to find that I was overwieht with a BMI of 28.3 (not far from obese). I told the guys at work about this and they said it was nonsense. They said I didn't need to lose weight and that the doctor hadn't taken into account my 'athletic' build. Althletic? Okay I have kind of broad shoulders but I don't have the kind of muscles that would put a BMI that far out of whack. So why were they so sure I was OK? Because if I was overweight, they probably were too.
		</p>

		<p>
			Today I weigh in at about 73kg and with a BMI of 21.3. That's almost perfect. To be honest, once I got below 85kg I wasn't even trying anymore. 85kg was my goal. How did I do it? I changed my diet.

		<h3>Protein and other things</h3>

		<p>
			Being a Vegan, you often hear the question "where do you get your protein from?" Why are you so interested in protein? Where do you get your vitamins from? Where do you get your nutrients from? These are the things people are lacking in, we get more than enough protein. More than 60% of the world gets its protein from plants. Are you tired in the afternoon? Do you need coffee or energy drinks to keep your energy levels up? Do you have trouble focusing? Do you suffer from chronic diseases like obesity, diabetes, heart disease or auto immune conditions? These are DIET RELATED DISEASES along with many forms of cancer. This is not the way it is supposed to be. You are experiencing this because you are not giving your body what it needs.
		</p>

		<h3>Cancer</h3>

		<p>
			Cancer? Diet related? I must be crazy to think this right? Our doctors tell us that chemotherapy and other horrible treatments are the best weapon against cancer. WRONG. Chemotherapy has about a 30% success rate regardless of how progressed the cancer is. Chemotherapy IS A CARCINOGEN. The Gerson Therapy, which uses your body as the weapon with which to fight cancer, has had great results but it is illegal for your doctor to tell you about it. It is illegal to suggest a therapy without any major side effects because it is 'not proven to be effective' but it is perfectly legal to suggest a therapy with hoirrible side effects that has been PROVEN TO BE INEFFECTIVE.
		</p>

		<h3>Do Not Go On A Diet</h3>

		<p>
			So I guess to summarise: eat well, not too much and do not underestimate the value of a healthy diet. Yes, diet is important. Hugely important. I cannot overstate its importance. Do not confuse this for advice to go on a diet though. Going on a diet implies that you are doing it for a limited time. A week maybe? Or a month? How long after that month to you expect to stay healthy? Do not go on a diet. CHANGE YOUR LIFESTYLE. If you want to be heathy, you must live healthily. There is no substitute for this.
		</p>

		<h3>A Guide To Good Food</h3>

		<p>
			So then, how do you know what food is good to eat and what is bad? When I go to the local organic store (or if I'm unlucky, the cold, factory-like supermarket) I have a mental checklist for everything I buy. I don't always require all of these things before I will buy something but don't go making excuses left right and center or this checklist will be worthless.
		</p>

		<h4>Whole</h4>

		<p>
			There are a lot of food-like products in the supermarket. They have food in them but they have non-food too. The only thing I want to eat is food. I want to eat it in its natural form too. As a general rule of thumb, the more processing it has gone through, the lower the nutritional content and the higher the non-food content. I have two main strategies for choosing food that is whole:
		</p>

		<ul>
			<li>Stick to the ouside of the supermarket. That's where the whole food lives: ingredients. Fruit, vegetables, nuts, seeds, grains, meats etc. Things that you know to be food from nature.</li>
			<li>If you do venture into the sea of food-like products that lives in the inner supermarket and buy something that is not an ingredient but instead lists ingredients, examine the ingredient label. If you find anything in the ingredients that is not food, don't buy it and don't eat it. Things that are not food include high fructuse corn syrup (HFCS), colours (which by New Zealand law could be ANYTHING!), preservatives etc.</li>
		</ul>

		<h4>Organic</h4>

		<p>
			Unfortunately organic has been reduced by corporations to mean less than you might think. An organic plant must be grown without the use of sprays like herbicides, pesticides, insecticides and artificial fertilizers. An organic animal must be fed using only organic feed. It does not guarantee anything else about the farming practices. Monoculture and factory farming still exist in what Michael Pollen has termed 'industrial organic'.
		</p>

		<p>
			Having said that, it is still a step in the right direction. The soils are so much healthier which makes the plants so much healthier which means they are more nutrient dense and hense healthier for us.
		</p>

		<h4>Local</h4>

		<p>
			Capitalism and globalisation have ensured that we use as much energy as possible to produce our food. Agriculture is one of the highest consuming industries of fossil fules. On top of that, now they want us to eat something that was grown half way across the world? That's a lot of wasted energy and a hugely impersonal proposition. Buying local food helps your local economy. It enables you to engage with the grower at a personal level. It helps the resiliance of your community.
		</p>

		<h4>Vegan</h4>

		<p>
			I do not wish to be involved in the harm of animals. Some argue that to eat meat is not to kill the animal yourself and therefore you are not causing any pain but I think that is a cop out. If I want to eat meat, I should be prepared to kill the animal myself. I am not prepared to do that so I do not eat it. Dairy and eggs are taken from animals that suffer during their lifetime to bring it to you. Free range is another term that has been defined by the corporations to mean not much at all. I will eat dairy and eggs if I can be sure they came from animals that are treated with respect but I don't feel any real need to do so.
		</p>

		<h4>Raw</h4>

		<p>
			Like other forms of processing, cooking (generally, but not always) reduces the nutritional value of food. It also kills off the enzymes that our body needs to help digestion and other processes. I wouldn't call myself a raw foodist (yet...) but I do eat a lot of raw food. I make sure that at least 50% of the food I eat is raw. Juices, smoothies, salads. In time you will come to love these. They will become your candy. Speaking of candy, don't get me started on raw deserts...

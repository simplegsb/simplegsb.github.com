		<p>
			i stand on a tiny island
			<br />
			surrounded by a turbulent sea
			<br />
			she swims to me through the waters
			<br />
			they are like glass to her touch
			<br />
			a clarity has returned
			<br />
			as she swims away again
			<br />
			i see my island has grown
			<br />
			when it stretches to the horizon
			<br />
			i will call it home

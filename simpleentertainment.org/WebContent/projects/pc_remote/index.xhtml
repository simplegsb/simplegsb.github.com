                <h1>Motivation</h1>
                
                <p>This project was, strangely enough, a spinoff from the related <a href="../pc_remote_for_android/index.xhtml">PC Remote for Android</a> project. During the design of that project it became apparent that the Android specific portion of the project was nothing more than a fancy GUI client for an underlying server-client model. Seeing the possibilities for multiple clients and servers all based off of the same basic model as the <a href="../pc_remote_for_android/index.xhtml">PC Remote for Android</a> project, it was decided that it should be a project in its own right. And here we are.</p>
                
                <h1>What is it?</h1>
                
                <p>PC Remote is a simple client and server that leverages the Java <a href="http://download.oracle.com/javase/6/docs/api/java/awt/Robot.html">Robot</a> class to provide control of a PC's mouse and keyboard from a remote location.</p>
                
                <h1>How do I use it?</h1>
                
                <p>To include PC Remote in one of your projects all you need to do is <a href="downloads.xhtml">download</a> your favourite flavour and include it in your classpath. You can read the <a href="../../wiki/pc_remote">documentation</a> to learn about how to leverage its awesome power. Just remember that we have licensed it using the <a href="http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl.html">GPL</a> and as a result you are only able to include it in your project if it, too, is distributed under the GPL.</p>

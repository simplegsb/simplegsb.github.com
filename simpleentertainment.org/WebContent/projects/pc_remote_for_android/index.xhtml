                <h1>Motivation</h1>
                
                <p>Well, I was watching a movie in the lounge one day via my PC and wanted to be able to control said movie from the comfort of the couch. My laptop didn't have a remote so - needless to say - I was in a bind. "Eureka!" I thought to myself. "I have an Android phone, surely I can download an app that will do this for me." So I did. The app I downloaded did the job but it didn't look very nice, wasn't very flexible and wasn't that easy to use. Having been looking for an excuse to try out an Android project, I took it on myself to make something better. PC Remote for Android is that something.</p>
                
                <p>I have to admit though, the quality of apps coming out of the Android Market has improved in the months since then and there are now a few good options for remotes of this kind. I don't claim that PC Remote for Android is the best, but it is free (as in freedom and free beer).</p>
                
                <h1>What is it?</h1>
                
                <p>PC Remote for Android is an easy to use, flexible remote that allows you to control your PC - wait for it... - remotely! Using your Android device! It's a miracle of modern science. You can control the mouse and keyboard and have easy access to commonly used keys such as the arrow keys, enter and escape (or whatever is important to you).</p>
                
                <h1>How do I use it?</h1>
                
                <p>Well, the easiest way is to download it from the Android Market. You can read the <a href="../../wiki/pc_remote_for_android.xhtml">documentation</a> to learn about how to use it, although for you young whippersnappers these days it should be pretty self explanatory. Note that you will also need to install <a href="../pc_remote/index.xhtml">a small server</a> on your PC.</p>

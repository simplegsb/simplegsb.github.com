		<p>I have a wide range of experience after 10+ years in the industry. During that time I have consistently stood out as one of the most sought after members of any team from J2EE enterprise applications to mobile apps and games. <a onclick="$(this).fadeOut(); $('.cv').slideDown();">More about my abilities...</a></p>

		<div class="cv">
			<p><strong>I have a passion for high quality code that is as simple as possible.</strong> In my experience the number one cause of bugs and hard to maintain software is complexity. Writing simpler code that does the same job makes it easier for other developers to understand, reduces the chance for bugs, makes it easier to change later on and often even improves performance.</p>

			<p><strong>I learn new tech and concepts very quickly.</strong> I often jump into existing code-bases which almost inevitably use a technology or language that I have no previous experience with. I approach the new code-base and technologies etc. task by task, determining how much needs to be learned to effectively complete the task at hand without attempting to learn everything. This means that I can join a project and be effective straight away.</p>

			<p><strong>I pay a lot of attention to the details.</strong> Although I do not attempt to learn everything about a given technology to perform a single task in a project that uses it, I will learn what I need to know to perform that task to a high standard. Not just to get it done but to get it done well. I always try to find the canonical method and use the strengths of the project, languages and technologies. I will also look for weaknesses in the project. If I find one I will either improve it, raise it as a problem to be dealt with later or just leave it. I stay on task, I do not attempt to fix everything.</p>

			<p>I have experience with lots of platforms: Android, iOS, Windows RT, Windows Phone and Linux</p>

			<p>using lots of languages: C++, Java, C#, HTML/CSS, JavaScript and Python</p>

			<p>and too many technologies, libraries and frameworks etc. to list here.</p>

			<p>Oh, and I have a Bachelor of Computing and Mathematical Sciences from the University of Waikato.</p>

			<p><strong>Reference:</strong> David Keeley (Technical Program Manager)</p>
			<p><strong>Position:</strong> Senior Developer</p>

			<p>I worked primarily on two of their web based enterprise solutions, <a href="http://bravurasolutions.com/solutions/products/wealth-and-life-administration-systems/sonata">Sonata</a> (Web) and eTalis in Agile environments. Both used technology stacks that I had almost no experience with but by the end of my time there I was the authority on most of them in the office where I worked due to my quick ability to learn.</p>

			<p>I also often worked on technical roadmap tasks designed to improve the robustness and maintainability of the software. These tasks were often related to the merging the two products Sonata (Web) and eTalis and taking the best approaches from both into the final result.</p>

			<p>Before I left I was asked to perform training of employees wishing to move to development of web-based products which used a lot of different technologies and patterns from the desktop applications they had worked on previously.</p>

			<p>Later I returned for a short term contract where I worked on the workflow engine of Sonata and - in the few months that I was there - became it's most knowledgeable developer (apart from it's original developer who was not coding anymore) and began to improve it's architecture.</p>

			<h2>Matrikon <small><a href="http://www.matrikon.com">[matrikon.com]</a></small></h2>

			<p><strong>Position:</strong> Software Engineer</p>

			<p>I developed customizations and extensions to the <a href="http://www.maximoassetmanagement.com">Maximo</a> system, an enterprise quality J2EE framework owned by IBM. I also developed integrations to Oracle Apps, SAP and others. The majority of this work was Java coding and database scripting with XML and JSP for the UI elements.</p>

			<p>I liaised with clients, often unsupervised and on-site, determined their needs, designed and implemented solutions, tested these solutions and deployed them to the clients' systems.</p>

			<p>At times I was responsible for teaching and delegating work to up to three other developers. When I left I was the senior Maximo developer in the Canadian HQ office.</p>

In this instance the Service Management flavour of Maximo was being used for the ordering of certain communications required for military deployments.</p>

			<p>I advised on the best practices and solutions that could be used to implement this functionality before engaging in designing, developing and testing those solutions in an Agile environment.</p>

			<p>During this time I delegated work to up to two other developers. Although I was offered an extension to my contract by various parties I was not satisfied with the location of the work and so sought work elsewhere.</p>

			<h2>simplicity</h2>

			<a class="ui icon" href="https://github.com/simple-entertainment/simplicity">
				<i class="large github icon" />
			</a>

			<p>simplicity is a game engine I am creating. Originally it was written in Java but I ported it to C++11. This engine was superceded by the <a onclick="openSection('section', 'mediaDesignSchool'); openSection('subSection', 'gazEngine');">GazEngine</a> middleware I used for my projects at Media Design School where I could not use C++11. I have now taken the much more comprehensive and tested code from <a onclick="openSection('section', 'mediaDesignSchool'); openSection('subSection', 'gazEngine');">GazEngine</a> back to simplicity and C++11 and continued to expand on it.</p>

			<code>
				#include &lt;simplicity/API.h&gt;
				</br>
				</br>
				int main()
				</br>
				{
					</br>
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Simplicity::addEngine(...);
					</br>
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Simplicity::getScene()->addEntity(...);
					</br>
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Simplicity::play();
					</br>
					</br>
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;return 0;
					</br>
				}
			</code>

			<h3>Features</h3>

			<ul>
				<li><strong>Modular:</strong> Allows systems to be swapped in and out with minimal changes required e.g. swapping from Direct3D to OpenGL</li>
				<li><strong>Entities:</strong> Entities are constructed using composition, not inheritance to avoid class heirarchy explosions. Components are also interfaced to minimise dependencies on particular implementations</li>
				<li><strong>Input:</strong> Inputs from the mouse and keyboard are abstracted to allow swapping in and out of possible event sources e.g. swapping from FreeGLUT to GLFW</li>
				<li><strong>Logging:</strong> Logs to multiple resources with "printf" style formatting, severities and tags</li>
				<li><strong>Maths:</strong> Matrix and Vector implementations and other useful functions</li>
				<li><strong>Messaging:</strong> Messages are mediated to allow swapping in and out of possible message sources and destinations with minimal changes e.g. swapping from FreeGLUT to GLFW</li>
				<li><strong>Models:</strong> Provides functions for the creation of basic mesh shapes e.g. cubes</li>
				<li><strong>Resources:</strong> Resources (e.g. files) are abstracted to allow for different platforms and resource types</li>
				<li><strong>Scripting:</strong> Scripts can be written in C++ with callbacks for various lifecycle events</li>

				<li>If a cat gets stuck, it will attempt to turn around.</li>
				<li>The mouse is surrounded by a large approach radius, when the cats enter it they will begin to slow down.</li>
